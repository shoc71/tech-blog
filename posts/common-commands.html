                I don't want to keep looking up the commands for
                some these ones and a few them are just disgustingly
                long.

                My First Problem; trying to remember the equalivent of 
                what works for powershell, cmd, and linux since none of
                them are ever consistent. An example; 
                <a href="#rm">Removing Directories</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                
                I would much rather Archived, OutDated, or even Revised
                if there was a consistent through lin with all of them

                There are two ways this can be done. 1. The character has the
                freedom to explore who they are and what they can do. 2. The
                character is restricted by rules from doing whatever they want.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's also the mindset needed for them to be intelligent thinkers
                or for it have the opposite effect. 
            </p>
            <div class="p-4">
                <p>
                    1. The character must play by the rules effectively
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. The character mut find the truth hidden within the truth.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                The character(s) like the audience first learn of the rules of 
                the games and then actively test and see what they can get away 
                with and what rules are enforced rigorously and what is 
                intentionally left out.
            </p>
            <p>
                The rules exist to prevent the intelligent character from doing
                directly what they want so they have to work around the rules to 
                get what they want, through any means necessary (this is where the
                character trait comes into play.)

            <p class="text-center">
                The important part is here, is the discovery. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The character must show how they got to the solution and the logic behind it.
                It's like your math teacher screaming at you to show your work for getting the
                right solution when you have memorized the answer and wrote it and said "I read 
                the solutions and put it in here."

                    - Very Observant

                    - Analytical
                    - Deception (a personality trait more than anything)
                    - Confidence (a personality trait more than anything)
