                This is the perfect excuse to research your topic and to know it well.
                I'm calling you a crying baby (if you don't know the subject you're talking
                about that well) because this is what you'll become when you get called out
                for your ignorance and continue to double-down on your factually incorrect
                takes. Apolgize, Amend, and Move on.
            </p>
            <p class="text-center">
                It's ok to get things wrong. Rarely is anyone 100% correct in all context and with time on their side.
            </p>
            <p>
                The important thing is you took the time to learn and share what you learned.
                We're perfecting an imperfect craft to meet an impossible standard. My anger comes
                from authors that contradict their continuaity like rules and information established
                in their own piece (which I can understand sometimes happening, only if you work 
                alone BUT never on a team) and they intentionally spend time either correcting/clarfying 
                the record or doubling down on a contradiction, both of which is time spent away
                from either from researching a new work or crafting a new masterpiece. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To me, the worst offender(s) is an author that:
                <ol class="mx-6">
                    <li>Contradicting their own premise / main message of the story</li>
                    <li>Attempting to demonstrate a character trait as one thing but the actions display something else</li>
                </ol>
                I'll give examples of both later on.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cite it in your notes and your drafts if you have to. The last thing
                you want to do is to have the concieted idea that you know better than
                your audience (whom you should ALWAYS assume will attempt to fact check you).
                I feel like shouldn't even need to mention this but a small group of people
                will go out of their to fact check if the information you're writing is 
                factually correct. Even if your work is entirely in fiction, you (the author) make references
                to real world objects and work(s) like mentioning a door or referencing the Bible. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-center">Always do your Research.</p>
            <p>
                With the example of the door, nothing's wrong with having a normal door or 
                you can take one step further by showing how unique the door is via design, opening mechanics, etc. 
                The important part is the main function of the door must remain consistent. 
                (A barrier seperating two different areas or dividing an enclosure via its access to the other side). 
                Any semantic play on something like this will be confusing to the audience.
            </p>
            <p class="text-center">If the function of the object differs from it's normal use, it's ALWAYS worth mentioning.</p>

            <p class="text-center">Consistency from the real-world MATTERS.</p>
            <p>
                Your audience (especially the smart ones) will greatly appreciate when you
                (the author) research your topic, cite your sources, and beautifully craft
                in your ways about a topic that deserve the respect that your audience gives
                to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's no excuse for not doing this.
                A big exmaple of this terrible planning in a plot and it feels disingioues
                to both the audience (excited to learn and enjoy while doing so) 
                and the author that wrote it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Audiences ALWAYS crave for good well-written out stories and there aren't
                enough of them out there.
            </p>
            <p>
                You (the author) are letting yourself down by not improving or even using this
                chance to learn. Even if the story doesn't hit the shelves, you have learned 
                something new and have a new found apprication for it and it will become a book
                of knowledge that you can reference when you want to write a new story with a 
                similar subject matter.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the one profession that allows you to pour everything including your 
                intelligence into a craft.
